## Features
- **Add Tasks:** Users can input a new task into the text field and add it to the list by clicking the "Add" button.
- **Delete Tasks:** Each task has a delete button (trash can icon) to remove it from the list.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is responsive and works on different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Task Management:** Tasks are dynamically displayed, and users can manage them without reloading the page.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Structure of the web application.
- **CSS:** Styling for the application, including layout, colors, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript:** Handles the dynamic aspects of the application, such as adding and deleting tasks.


## Usage
Once the application is running, you can start managing your tasks:

1. **Add a Task:**
   - Type your task in the input field labeled "Add your task here..."
   - Click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.

2. **Delete a Task:**
   - Click the trash can icon next to a task to remove it from the list.

## Code Structure
- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that structures the application.
- **`style.css`**: Contains all the CSS styles for the application.
- **`Todo.js`**: JavaScript file that handles task management (adding and deleting tasks).

## Customization
You can customize the application by editing the CSS and HTML files:

- **Change Colors:** Modify the colors by editing the values in `style.css`.
- **Alter Layout:** Adjust the layout by tweaking the flexbox settings or padding/margins in `style.css`.
- **Add Features:** You can extend the JavaScript in `Todo.js` to add new features, such as task editing, sorting, or saving tasks in local storage.

## Known Issues
- **Task Overflow:** Long tasks might overflow the task container. You can handle this by adding CSS to truncate or wrap text.
- **No Persistence:** Currently, tasks are not saved when the page is reloaded. This can be improved by using `localStorage`.

## Future Enhancements
- **Task Persistence:** Implementing `localStorage` to save tasks between sessions.
- **Task Editing:** Allowing users to edit tasks after they have been added.
- **Task Prioritization:** Adding a feature to prioritize tasks with different colors or icons.
